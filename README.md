# Shopping-List-V2

this project is aimed at helping users track their items in a shopping e-commerce site more efficiently. The first action of any new user is to create an acount using the signup html page. After the account for the user has being created, the user signs in to the account whereby he/she works on the dashboard account for the user. One of the features of the dashboard is to allow the user to keep a track of listed items on his/her wishlist.
